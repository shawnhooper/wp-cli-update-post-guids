# Description

This plugin registers a new WP-CLI command that will update every post and page's `guid` column (in wp_posts) with the current full permalink to the post.  

So, for example instead of having `https://example.com/?p=1`, it would replace it with `https://example.com/blog/2024/01/01/first-post/`
